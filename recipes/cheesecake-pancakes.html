    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Cheesecake pancakes are a delightful fusion of two beloved breakfast classics, seamlessly blending the rich, creamy indulgence of a cheesecake with the comforting warmth of fluffy pancakes. These delectable treats elevate the traditional pancake experience to a whole new level of decadence and flavor. The pancake batter is infused with the luscious essence of cream cheese, imparting a velvety texture and a subtle tangy undertone that perfectly complements the sweetness of the pancake itself. Each bite offers a harmonious marriage of textures â€” the soft and airy pancake layers interwoven with pockets of creamy cheesecake goodness. The edges of the pancakes delicately caramelize, creating a tantalizing contrast to the smooth, melt-in-your-mouth center. To enhance the overall experience, a drizzle of velvety maple syrup or a sprinkle of powdered sugar can be added, intensifying the sweetness and adding a touch of elegance.</p>
        <p>Cheesecake pancakes are not just a breakfast indulgence; they also make for a sumptuous brunch or a delightful dessert option. Whether enjoyed as a special weekend treat or a celebratory morning feast, these pancakes redefine the boundaries of traditional breakfast fare, turning an ordinary meal into a memorable culinary experience that satisfies both the sweet tooth and the pancake enthusiast in every bite.</p>

            <li>1/4 Tsp. Vanilla Extract</li>

            <li>2 Tsp. Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp. Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/4 Tsp. Salt</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg (<em>Lightly Beaten</em>)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups Buttermilk</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>Topping of Choice (<em>Graham Crackers, Powdered Sugar, Maple Syrup, etc.)</em></li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>For the topping:</strong> Combine strawberries and jam in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer. Let it cool. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>For the cream cheese mixture:</strong> In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, three (3) tablespoons of sugar, milk, and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Transfer this mixture to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>For the pancake batter:</strong> Combine flour, remaining two (2) tablespoons of sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. In a separate medium bowl, combine the egg, buttermilk, and oil. Add this egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until moistened (<em>batter should be slightly lumpy</em>).</li>
            <li>Once complete, heat an extra-large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup portions of the pancake batter onto the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cook until bottoms are golden brown, edges are slightly dry, and bubbles form at the edges of the pancakes (<em>approximately 2-3 minutes</em>).</li>
            <li>Pipe a swirl of cream cheese mixture from the bag onto each pancake starting from the center.</li>
            <li>Coat the uncooked side of the pancakes with cooking spray. Turn and cook for 2-3 minutes on the other side as well. Repeat with the remaining batter and cream cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Serve with the strawberry topping on top and sprinkle with your topping of choice.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
