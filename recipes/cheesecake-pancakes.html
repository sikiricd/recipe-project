    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Cheesecake pancakes are a delightful fusion of two beloved breakfast classics, seamlessly blending the rich, creamy indulgence of cheesecake with the comforting warmth of fluffy pancakes. These delectable treats elevate the traditional pancake experience to a whole new level of decadence and flavor. The pancake batter is infused with the luscious essence of cream cheese, imparting a velvety texture and a subtle tangy undertone that perfectly complements the sweetness of the pancake itself. Each bite offers a harmonious marriage of textures â€” the soft and airy pancake layers interwoven with pockets of creamy cheesecake goodness. The edges of the pancakes delicately caramelize, creating a tantalizing contrast to the smooth, melt-in-your-mouth center. To enhance the overall experience, a drizzle of velvety maple syrup or a sprinkle of powdered sugar can be added, intensifying the sweetness and adding a touch of elegance.</p>
        <p>Cheesecake pancakes are not just a breakfast indulgence; they also make for a sumptuous brunch or a delightful dessert option. Whether enjoyed as a special weekend treat or a celebratory morning feast, these pancakes redefine the boundaries of traditional breakfast fare, turning an ordinary meal into a memorable culinary experience that satisfies both the sweet tooth and the pancake enthusiast in every bite.</p>

            <li>5 Tbsp. White Sugar (Divided)</li>
            <li>2 Tsp. Milk</li>
            <li>1/4 Tsp. Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 3/4 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 Tsp. Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 Tsp. Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/4 Tsp. Salt</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg (Lightly Beaten)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups Buttermilk</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>Graham Crackers, Powdered Sugar, or Topping of Choice</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Starting with the topping, combine strawberries and jam in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer; set aside.</li>
            <li>Next, in a small bowl, combine cream cheese, three (3) tablespoons of sugar, milk, and vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. This will be our cream cheese swirl mixture. Transfer this mixture to a pastry bag or a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off; set aside.</li>
            <li>For the pancake batter, combine flour, remaining two (2) tablespoons of sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine the egg, buttermilk, and oil.</li>
            <li>Add this egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until moistened (batter should be slightly lumpy).</li>
            <li>Heat an extra-large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup portions of batter onto the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cook until bottoms are golden brown and edges are slightly dry and bubbles form at the edges of the pancakes, 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pipe a swirl of cream cheese mixture from the bag onto each pancake starting from the center.</li>
            <li>Coat the uncooked side of the pancakes with cooking spray. Turn and cook for 2-3 minutes on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter and cream cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Serve with the strawberry topping and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs, powdered sugar or your topping of choice.</li>
        </ol>
